# MiRack-Patches
Patches for the MiRack Eurorack simulator.


This repository contains patches that I created while mucking about with [miRack](https://mirack.app/) 


* Doodle2 - My first entry into mucking about with MiRack
* Template LogicProX - a template to properly control the 'Clocked - module' start, stop and loop using the LogicPro buttons
